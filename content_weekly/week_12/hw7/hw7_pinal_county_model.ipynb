    "# Homework 7: Exploring and Analyzing the Pinal County MODFLOW Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work with a real-world, professional groundwater model from the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). As you know, the Pinal County model represents the Pinal Active Management Area in central Arizona and includes:\n",
    "- 3 layers (vs 1 layer in tutorials), plus much larger spatial extent\n",
    "- Monthly stress periods tracking transient pumping impacts\n",
    "- Real pumping data from wells across the basin\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Load and inspect a large, multi-layer, transient groundwater model\n",
    "2. Visualize model input parameters including hydraulic conductivity and well locations\n",
    "3. Run the model and verify successful execution\n",
    "4. Evaluate temporal changes in hydraulic head at specific locations\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with **`PM_AWS2019_SS25115.nam`** in the `model_input_directory` folder, which includes (among many other files):\n",
    "- WEL (Well) package with pumping wells\n",
    "- LPF (Layer Property Flow) package with spatially-variable hydraulic conductivity\n",
    "- RCH (Recharge) and EVT (Evapotranspiration) packages\n",
    "- CHD (Constant Head) boundaries representing regional flow\n",
    "- 194 stress periods \n",
    "\n",
    "You will first explore the model structure (visualizing K, wells), then run the simulation, and finally analyze the results to understand how pumping affects the aquifer."

    "2. Explore the model structure by visualizing key input parameters\n",
    "3. Run the model and verify successful execution\n",
